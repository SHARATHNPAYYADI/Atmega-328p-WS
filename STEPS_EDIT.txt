	Now, open all programs> WinAvr XXXXXXXXXXX>Mfile. 
	Click, MakeFile> MCUtype>Atmega>atmega16.
	Click, MakeFile> Programmer> avrispv2.
	Click, MakeFile> Port> USB.
	Click, MakeFile> Enable Editing of makefile.
 	
	Now in the text below, replace F_CPU = 8000000 TO F_CPU = 1000000. 
	File> Save As> SAve in your my project folder. Do not rename the makefile.


	
STEP4:	Again, Open Programmers notepad window, and include this preprocessor directive "#define F_CPU 1000000UL" in your previously written program
	Save it, and Now go to Tools> Make All.
	
	Now Close the WinAVR.
	
	
STEP5:	Open Burn O Mat, Settings> AVRdude> 

	Replace the first address with the winAvr location one, that is, "C:\WinAVR\bin\avrdude.exe." by browsing.

	Replace the second address with the winAvr location one, that is, "C:\WinAVR\bin\avrconfig.exe." by browsing.


	Click apply> OK.
	CLose and again open Burn o Mat.
	Settings> AVRdude> Programmer>USBASP.
	Settings> AVRdude> Port>USB.
	
	Click apply> OK.


	
FINAL:	Connect the Atmega16, SIX ICSP pins to the burner IC pins.
	Go to the main window of Burn o Mat,
